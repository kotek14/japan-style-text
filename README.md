# japan-style-text
It generates vertical messages.

```
python3 japan.py "basically you get output like this when you use this script"

b y g o l t w y u t s

s u t t k i e u e i r 
i     p e s n     s i 
c     u             p 
a     t             t 
l                     
l                     
y                     
```

As someone pointed out, it would be nice to have the text generate right to left. To do so, uncomment line 18 and comment out line 17.

```
python3 japan.py "this is what happend if you uncomment line 18 and comment out line 17"

      t       e     d       
              n             
              t             
```
